    VELOCIraptor catalogue reader. Pass it the name of a catalogue file and it
    will detect whether this catalogue is self-contained or part of a larger
    split catalogue consisting of multiple files.

    When a split catalogue is used, any of the catalogue.properties.X files can
    be passed on to the constructor, where X is a counter ranging from 0 to
    properties_file["Num_of_files"]-1. When a dataset is extracted from such a
    catalogue, the elements in the resulting dataset will be ordered in blocks
    of increasing X.

    For split catalogues, this class's read_field() method handles reading the
    distributed datasets. For unsplit catalogues, it behaves exactly the same
    as a direct read from the HDF5 file.
